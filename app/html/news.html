    <h1>Fortnite old map locations are weirdly sad right now</h1>

    <h3>
      The once opalescent locales of Grand Glacier and Lavish Lair are not what
      they used to be in Fortnite.
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Players can still visit these locations in the current Chapter 5 Season 2
      map, but they do not have the character they used to. The new update has
      taken away their boss fights and the vaults full of loot. Sure, you can
      still walk around each places hallowed halls, but everything feels a whole
      lot emptier. Now, fans have been posting melodramatic (and slightly funny)
      clips on TikTok sharing what they miss about the old version as they visit
      now lonely locations.

    <h3>
      The Lantern Fest in Fortnite can be tricky to find, so here's how to get
      into it to solve the Lost Lanterns and Riddles
    </h3>

    <h4>
      The Fortnite Lantern Festival is back for 2024, to once again celebrate
      the month of Ramadan with a selection of activities, challenges, and
      puzzles all housed in a special Lantern Fest Oasis map. You can use the
      Signal Remote device you start out with to jump to the different areas of
      this experience, and completing them will earn you XP while ultimately
      unlocking food items so you can lay the table for a feast. If you're
      trying to find the Lantern Festival in Fortnite or looking for solutions
      to the Lost Lanterns and Riddles, I'm here to help.
